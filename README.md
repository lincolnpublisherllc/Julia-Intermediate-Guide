README — Julia Intermediate Guide: Chapter-by-Chapter Code
Overview

This folder contains all code extracted from “Julia Intermediate Guide.docx”, organized by chapter. Each chapter has a single .jl file that collects every detected snippet in the order it appears in the manuscript.

If a chapter had no code detected, you will see a placeholder file with a short note inside.

What was extracted

The extractor looks for lines that resemble Julia or shell usage commonly shown in Julia books, such as:

using, import, include(...), Pkg.*

function, module, struct and end blocks

Control flow like for, while, if, elseif, else

Macros like @threads, @time, @benchmark, @test, @async, @spawn

Common package calls such as CSV.*, DataFrame(...), JSON.*, Plots.*

REPL or command lines like julia> or julia ... when they look like code usage

Blank lines are preserved within detected code runs to keep groups readable.

File naming

One file per chapter
NN_Chapter_X/NN_Chapter_X_code.jl

Introduction and other front matter
00_INTRODUCTION/00_INTRODUCTION_code.jl

This keeps imports and examples together so you can run or copy them as a set.

How to use

Open a chapter file in your editor or the Julia REPL.

Run blocks as needed. Some chapters may expect earlier imports or data paths.

If a chapter mixes shell commands and Julia, you may need to run the shell lines separately in your terminal.

Suggested Julia setup

Julia 1.9 or later

Create a project environment per chapter if the code uses different packages:

import Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()


Install any missing packages that appear in the code:

Pkg.add(["CSV", "DataFrames", "JSON", "Plots", "BenchmarkTools", "Test"])

Accuracy notes

The goal is to be accurate and complete. The extractor is careful, but any automated pass can miss a few edge cases:

False negatives
Code lines that read like prose can be skipped.

False positives
A line with end or mean( inside a sentence can be picked up if it looks code-like.

If you find an issue, see the “Customize or re-run extraction” section.

Known limitations

Mixed formatting inside the DOCX can hide code markers that are only visual, like font or shading.

Images and figures are not parsed.

Very short inline fragments can be ambiguous. The extractor leans toward including technical lines when in doubt.

Customize or re-run extraction

If you want to refine results, here are easy tweaks:

Separate files by snippet
I can split each chapter into snippet_001.jl, snippet_002.jl, and so on.

Filter by language
I can place shell lines in chapter.sh and Julia in chapter.jl.

Tighten or loosen detection
I can adjust the rules to include more or fewer borderline lines.

Preserve headings as comments
I can insert section headers from the book as # --- Section Name --- to make navigation easier.

Tell me which option you prefer and I will regenerate the set.

Verification checklist

Open each _code.jl and skim the top 30 to 50 lines.

Check that imports match the text of the chapter.

Confirm that multi-line function or module blocks start and end correctly.

If a chapter uses datasets or paths, verify the files exist or add small mock data where needed.

License and attribution

These files are extracted from your manuscript for your use. If you plan to publish the code, review package licenses and add your preferred license file to the root folder.
